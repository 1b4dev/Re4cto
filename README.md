# Re4cto - React Chat Client üí¨

React.js + Vite + TypeScript + React Bootstrap = Re4cto

## What is Re4cto?

Re4cto is React based chat client with the combination of four popular development technologies; React, Vite, TypeScript, Bootstrap. 

Re4cto features:
 - Uses functional programming as recommended by the current React documentation.
 - Uses custom fetch hook with error provider for fetch requests so fetch errors handled with simple bootstrap toast element.
 - Authentication for fetch hooks is based on Bearer token stored in the browser's local storage but can be converted to cookie based.
 - Uses short polling mechanism to retrieve messages so it can even work shared hosting plans.
 - Includes a Dockerfile to build for SaaS platforms.

 Build demo is available on:
